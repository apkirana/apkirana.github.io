# Paper Reviews

This repository hosts a simple website for my personal collection of paper reviews.

## Accessing the Website

You can access the live website at: **https://apkirana.github.io/**

## About this Site

This site is built with basic HTML and CSS.  It's designed to present a list of research papers with links to dedicated review pages for each paper.  The style is inspired by Wikipedia to provide a clean and readable layout.

## Project Structure

*   **`index.html`**:  The main page, listing the papers.
*   **`style.css`**:  The stylesheet for the site's appearance.
*   **`reviews/`**:  A directory containing individual HTML files for each paper review.  Each file (e.g., `reviews/paper1.html`) contains the detailed review for a specific paper.
